# Stocks-analyst

Personal Stock market assistant.

This project helping me to learn python and also make an stock filtration list using python


Future steps for this project
Make as many back testing setup as possibile. 
Dynamically use API and fetch data of a stock.
For insider candle setup - 
Make 3 to 20 days insider candle pattern stock.

Can think of many strategies like these and apply them using the code to backtest the data and
then also use as a stock screener where it fetches data from API to list me all the stocks which comes in each setup with 
it's probability of succession. 

Add more creteria to see if volume helps.
Find stocks which are side ways and stuck in a zone.

Bollinger band setup and how many days it stays inside it for the maximum.

Figure out a way to fetch data of options and it's premiun so that we can judge upon the decay
Figure out a way to perfectly calcuate decay using IV and other factors.
 

Future Future ->
Figure out how you can teach this if a stock is good or not. Then based upon technicals and fundamental analysis let it give out the suggested stock which can taken.
